                <h2><mark>Women in Art<br>Throughout History</mark> </h2><br>
                <p>Women in art have played a vital yet often overlooked role throughout history, shaping artistic movements and redefining creativity despite societal barriers. </p>
                <p>From the Renaissance works of Artemisia Gentileschi to the modern innovations of Frida Kahlo and Yayoi Kusama, female artists have challenged conventions, expressed resilience, 
                    and captured unique perspectives on identity, culture, and emotion. Though historically marginalized, their contributions continue to gain recognition, proving that art is not 
                    only a reflection of the world but also a powerful tool for change.</p>

                    <p>Human perception of the body is so acute and knowledgeable that the smallest hint of a body can trigger recognition.<br> 
                        —Jenny Saville</p>
                    <p>In her depictions of the human form, Jenny Saville transcends the boundaries of both classical figuration and modern abstraction. Oil paint,
                        applied in heavy layers, becomes as visceral as flesh itself, each painted mark maintaining a supple, mobile life of its own. As Saville pushes, 
                        smears, and scrapes the pigment over her large-scale canvases, the distinctions between living, breathing bodies and their painted representations 
                        begin to collapse. </p> 
                    <p>Born in 1970 in Cambridge, England, Saville attended the Glasgow School of Art from 1988 to 1992, 
                        spending a term at the University of Cincinnati in 1991. Her studies focused her interest in “imperfections” of flesh, 
                        with all of its societal implications and taboos.</p>

                    <img src="Jerome-Lag.jpg" alt="An artist working on a masterpiece">
                    <p>Jerome Lagarrigue is a French-American painter known for his dynamic portraiture and exploration of identity, movement, 
                        and emotion. Born in 1973 in Paris, he studied illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design and later transitioned 
                        into fine art. His work, often blending realism with abstraction, captures the nuances of human expression and social themes. 
                        Lagarrigue has exhibited internationally and received numerous accolades, solidifying his place as a contemporary master of figurative painting.</p>
